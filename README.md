# Sunspot 
The following repository contains data as well as python notebook along with functions that can be used to calculate sunspot areas from white light images. Images are from the Royal University of Belgium.
All instructions to use the code is provided in the code file. This project was an extension of my summer internship where we tried to measure the rotation periods of the sunspots.
