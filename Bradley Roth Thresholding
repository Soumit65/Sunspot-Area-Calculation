# Bradley–Roth Adaptive Thresholding

This repository implements the Bradley–Roth adaptive thresholding
algorithm for images with non-uniform illumination.

## Algorithm
For each pixel, a local mean is computed using an integral image.
The pixel is classified as foreground if its intensity exceeds
a fraction of the local mean.

## Advantages
- Fast (O(N))
- Robust to illumination gradients
- Suitable for real-time applications

## Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
```python
binary = bradley_roth_threshold(image, window_size=15, t=0.15)
